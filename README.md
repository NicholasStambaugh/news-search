# Simplified News Searches using NewsAPI.org

Simplified News Searches is a project that uses the NewsAPI.org service to retrieve news articles from a variety of sources. The goal of the project is to make it easy for users to find news articles from a wide variety of sources. Developed using a flask framework.

## Things I'd Like To Add

+ Filters: Currently, the project allows users to search for news articles based on keywords, but I would like to add filters that make it easy to select from a variety of topics related to economic development. These filters could include categories such as "Infrastructure", "Trade", "Investment", and "Policy", among others. Users would be able to select one or more filters to narrow down their search results.

+ Stylization: While the current version of the project is functional, the home page is fairly basic and could use some improvements in terms of design and stylization. I plan to work on this aspect of the project to make it more visually appealing and user-friendly.

+ Executable/Web: Currently, the project runs locally using Flask. However, I would like to explore the possibility of running the project on a server in the future, or even packaging it as an executable that can be installed on a user's computer.
